# Inventory Program
This program is built speicfically for the retail store I worked in part-time. The code has been edited overtime to work on a larger scale and have heavier error-checking.
"FINALbackend" is the final working code, that I is able to be run on our desktop at work through the windows CMD.
I'm looking to learn more about front end, and translate the code to build a website in HTML with to make the program more user friendly.
