"main" is code from my grade 12 CS course final project, which I upgraded throughout the summer.
The program made for my final project is for the store I work in part-time, and I edited the code to work on a larger scale and have heavier error-checking.
"FINALbackend" is the final working code, that I am currently able to run on our desktop at work through the windows CMD and a txt file for data.
I'm looking to learn more about front end, and translate the Java code into Javascript to build a website in HTML with it to make the program more user friendly!
