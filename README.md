The programming from my cs course, will be upgraded throughout the summer.
The main file and txt file were both done in replit (I know, I know) in java and I'm working on moving the code to start fresh. The program for the course required a
txt file, however it's more practical to store all the data in an arraylist. So the first step is to edit the program to send and recieve data from an arraylist, and 
scrap the txt file to make it more practical to be used in the real world!
